the Mother Plants are basically like uhhhh like. imagine ur mother, but as a plant

they're hidden throughout the planet meuva, (usually in semi-enclosed caves and parts of the ground) and heavily guarded by the meuvian CIA because big mr. president guy said so and no one is brave enough to unplug his life support

## HOW DOES IT WORK??

chat this is where meuvians come from

so basically whenever meuva's 2 moons reflect light off of each other in a specific way, when the specil light gets to a Mother Plant it does some goofy sciencey photosynthesis stuff but instead of growing it just lets off spores

the spores settle after a while and do whatever spores do, uhhhh um think of mushrooms i guess....heh..

then meuvii (small meuvian) develop from the spores

when they're done they just kinda. crawl out of there. if they take too long, the Mother Plant eats them

## structure
ermmm uhhh um i uh,,,, u

the planet gravity always pulls the plants to the center

so they,,,,,,,dont usually grw on te celing

ok wait thats difficult to understand,., . ., .,Due to gravity, they are always pulled toward the center. Therefore, those with irregular roots (the normal ones) don't end up growing on the ceiling because the roots are also influenced by gravity.

here have this diagram (the lines allow the roots to grow Downwards and onto the floor of the extraction zone)

HOWEVER!!!! IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GROW ON CEILING IF THEY ARENT CLOSE ENOUG TO A LINE (this is like really rare.. like.. really ra) also the mattresses usually dont work and they Die

also "they" refers to the meuvii

also theres a small little layer inbetween the peasant and extraction zone where theres a buncha mirrors that reflect sunlight onto the grounded motherplants
