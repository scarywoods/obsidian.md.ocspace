basically its a planet, but its Not in the solar system

the outside is too jolly so most organic life is on the inside, kinda like... an inverted planet (ermm actually its called [Buried Forest, Deciduously Insulated](https://battlefordreamisland.fandom.com/wiki/Buried_Forest,_Deciduously_Insulated))

also it has 2 moons, they have weird reflective surfaces that may or may not blind someone if its looked at wrong

the inside of the planet is kinda layered sorta kinda, the closer you get to the surface the colder it is, and the core is uh um its. its probably kinda toasty in there but not actually because they have a bunch of fans
