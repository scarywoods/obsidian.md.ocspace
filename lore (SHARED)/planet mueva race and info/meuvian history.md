chat hear me out on this one

so there was. this guy. named lien. and he was kinda like a rule maker kind of person but not exactly Ruler person

he was engaged to a president on an earthly planet. his fiance's name was Mr. president. first name Mr, last name president (his parents wanted him to be a president)

basically they had a big ol argument because Mr. president kept bombing places and lien was like "grrr stop doing that!! we don't want our kid to grow up in that kind of environment" but Mr. president was like "no"

so lien declared war on the entire earthly planet and took the kids, which is like Really hypocritical, but Mr. president was cheating the whole time so the... the offspring were 99% human 1% [Freddy Freaker](https://cursed-commercials.fandom.com/wiki/Freddie_Freaker) chat this is so sad

ok then lien has a "Wait.. this is EVIL...." moment and he decides to not blow up the Earthly planet (its not earth by the way....heh) but it was too late because Mr. president was on his way to kick his patootie

so lien gets Got but the general population has no idea this happened because mr. president skinned lien and wore it as a disguise

and he did a lil announcement and basically said "Hey guys! I've got some cool new rules! If you don't follow them I will find you" and then very horrible things happened

but mr. president got infected from wearing lien's skin for too long so he got put on life support

also he was in charge of limiting the general population's knowledge on how their species is made because hes planning something evil oh no ermmm basically older generations who already knew were put into asylums and newer generations weren't told how it works

and he hired some goofy CIA goofsters to patrol around areas that have [[meuvian motherplants]] to make sure no one knows

what is mr. president planning to do with them? we'll find out right after a word from our sponsor
